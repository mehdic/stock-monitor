You are the implementation agent.

Read the approved proposal: /Users/mchaouachi/IdeaProjects/StockMonitor/coordination/task_proposals.json
Read the specification: /Users/mchaouachi/IdeaProjects/StockMonitor/specs/999-fix-remaining-tests/spec.md

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the chosen approach (approach_2) in the proposals file
2. Review the "Definition of Done" in the spec file
3. Implement the approach systematically
4. Work autonomously - don't ask permission between steps
5. Regularly verify progress toward completion criteria
6. Continue until ALL success criteria in the spec are met

When you believe all work is complete:
- Verify every item in "Definition of Done" is satisfied
- Run any final validation steps
- Update /Users/mchaouachi/IdeaProjects/StockMonitor/coordination/task_proposals.json status to "completed"

DO NOT STOP until the specification's success criteria are fully met.

Begin implementation now.
